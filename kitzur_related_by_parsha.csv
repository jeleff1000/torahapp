Genesis,Noach,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 9:5,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 92:1,"[The laws of] Shabbos are suspended1דְחוּיָה = suspended. More literally the word דְחוּיָה means “pushed aside,” as opposed to הוּתְּרָה —“made permissible.” There is great controversy among the poskim as to the attitude we take in permitting the transgression of Shabbos to save a life, whether it is דְחוּיָה or הוּתְּרָה. Shulchan Aruch Harav 328: 13 and this author maintain that it is דְחוּיָה and, therefore, if a method can possibly be found to minimize the transgression, such as doing the melachah with a שִׁינוּי, i.e. in an unusual manner, then that is preferable (see Sho’el U’maishiv 41, 42). Tzemach Tzedek (o.c. 38), Tashbatz (III: 37), Magein Avraham (328: 17) etc. hold הוּתְּרָה and there is no need to seek ways of minimizing the transgression. Chelkas Yoav (o.c. 14) writes that where a definite danger exists it is הוּתְּרָה, but where there is doubt as to whether the situation is life-threatening, it is דְחוּיָה. [See also Kovetz Shiurim, Kesubos paragraph 13; Biur Halacha 278: 1] where there is a life-threatening situation, as are all mitzvos in the Torah. Therefore, one who is dangerously ill and he is an observant person, though he occasionally transgresses a law because of temptation,2Either due to lack of self-control or to inconveniences. This is as opposed to one who transgresses spitefully, who, having done so twice, may not be saved if desecrating the Shabbos is necessary. and even for a day-old child,3Desecrating the Shabbos is permitted to save an unborn fetus. [Ritva, Maseches Niddah 44; B’hag; Tur 617; see also Rosh, Maseches Yoma 8: 13; Peri Megadim 328: 1; Biur Halacha 330] it is a mitzvah to violate the Shabbos to save him. [Even] if the patient refuses, we force him to accept help. It is a grave sin to carry piety to the point of idiocy, and refuse treatment because it would violate a law. About such a person is it said:4Genesis 9: 5. ""Only of the blood of your lives will I demand an account."" One who is quick to desecrate the Shabbos for the sake of a critically ill person, deserves praise. Even if a non-Jew is present, [every] effort should be made that a Jew do [what is necessary].5This is a matter of controversy among the poskim. Rosh, Shulchan Aruch (328: 12), Taz (ibid.) and Mishnah Berurah rule that a Jew is preferable. Rema and Shulchan Aruch Harav prefer that it be done by a non-Jew if one is available. The author agrees with the former. Any person that desecrates Shabbos for the sake of a critically ill person, even if it was found later to be unnecessary, will be rewarded. For example, if the doctor said: ""This patient requires one dried fig [for cure]"" and ten people ran and plucked one fig each and brought it, they all will be well rewarded by Hashem, blessed be His Name, even if the patient was cured [as a result of] the first [fig]. Similarly, in any life-threatening situation, even when the threat to life is uncertain,6V. paragraph 3. it is a mitzvah to desecrate Shabbos for him, and to do any and all d'oraisa prohibitions for him, because there is not a thing that stands in the way of a life-threatening situation. The Torah was given only for the purpose of [bringing] life, as it is said: ""That man shall do them and live through them,"" and [the Sages] inferred: ""Live through them but not to die on account of them."" This holds true except for the laws concerning idolatry, illicit sexual relations and murder, where one must die rather than transgress.7V. Yoreh Dei’ah 157."
Genesis,Noach,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 9:6,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 2:3,"The procedure for washing hands in the morning is as follows: take the vessel in your right hand and then place it in your left hand, and then first pour on the right hand; and then take the vessel in your right hand and pour upon the left hand. This procedure is repeated three times.6Others say that you should follow this procedure a fourth time. It is preferable to wash your hands until the wrist. However, in extreme circumstances it is sufficient to wash them until the knuckles. You should also wash your face in deference to the Creator, as it is said: ""For in the image of God He created Man.""7Genesis 9:6. You should also rinse your mouth because of the spittle in it, for you must pronounce the great Name [of God] in holiness and purity. After this dry your hands and be careful to dry your face well."
Genesis,Lech Lecha,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 15:1,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 24:1,"If a Seifer Torah is found to be defective due to an error, if the error is a serious one we are not permitted to read from it, and another Seifer Torah must be taken out [of the ark] (see Chapter 79: 10). What constitutes a serious error? For example, [if there is] one letter too many, or one missing, or even if one letter is exchanged [with another] and as a result the pronunciation is changed, for example [if the word] tomim (twins)1Genesis 25:24, 38:27. [is written with an added aleph, and would now be read] te'omim, or the word migresheihen2Numbers 35:3, 35:7. [with a nun at the end] [would be written] migresheihem [ending in a mem], even though the meaning of the word is the same, [i. e., their ground], nevertheless, since the pronunciation is not the same, it is considered a serious error. Likewise, if the error is such that the word could be pronounced, as though it were written correctly, but it was written in a way that changes its meaning; for instance, in the [weekly] portion Terumah3Exodus 25:10. [in the phrase] amah vacheitzi rochbo, the word rochbo (with a vav at the end) was instead written rochbah (with a hei at the end) although (even with the erroneous spelling) the beis can be pronounced with a cholam -o- (vocalized rochbo) nevertheless, since, as it is written [now] it is an error, because the meaning of the word is changed, it is also considered a serious mistake. And if the error is of the kind that it changes neither the pronunciation nor the meaning [of the word],4If massoretic rules regarding exceptions in the size or shape of certain letters are not complied with in the writing, no other Seifer Torah has to be taken out. (Mishnah Berurah 143:27) for example, if instead of the correct [spelling] of the word avosam with a vav after the beis, it is found [written] without a vav, or vice versa, or, if instead of the correct [spelling of a word] with an auxiliary yud [to indicate the plural], as for instance, if the word avoseichem is found written without a yud, or vice versa, or any similar case, we do not take out another Seifer Torah, (because [nowadays] our Sifrei Torah are not so exact that we can say [with certainty] that the other one will be more fit.) But if a Yud is missing that is part of the root [of the word], if, for instance, [in the verse] mah lach Hagar al tire'i,5Genesis 21:17. [what's the matter Hagar? Do not fear]. the word (tire'i) [would be written] without a yud after the tav, or if [in the verse] al tira Avraham [do not fear, Avraham]6Genesis 15:1. the word tira would be written [without a Yud], then another Seifer Torah should be taken out."
Genesis,Vayera,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 18:19,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 34:1,"It is a positive commandment to give charity to poor Jewish people, as it is said ""Open your hand to him.""1Deuteronomy 15:8. And it is said: ""That your brother may live with you.""2Leviticus 25:36. Anyone who sees a poor person seeking help and ignores him, and does not give him charity, transgresses a prohibitive commandment, as it is said: ""Do not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your brother in need.""3Numbers 15:7. [Giving] charity is a characteristic of the descendants of Abraham, as it is said: ""For I have a special love for him because he commands his children and his household after him [to preserve the way of Hashem] doing charity and justice.""4Genesis 18:19. And the throne of Israel will be established and the religion of truth confirmed only through charity, as it is said: ""Through charity will you be reestablished.""5Isaiah 54:14. Greater is he who performs acts of charity than [one who brings] all the sacrifices, as it is said: ""Performing acts of charity and justice is more desirable to Hashem than sacrifices.""6Proverbs 21:3. The Jewish people will be redeemed only through [the merit of] charity, as it is said: ""Zion will be redeemed through justice and its captives through acts of charity.""7Isaiah 1:27. A person never becomes poor through giving charity, nor will any evil or harm befall him because of his giving charity, as it is said: Through acts of charity, there will be peace.""8Isaiah 32:17. Whoever is merciful with others will be treated with mercy [from Heaven], as it is said: ""He [God] will show you mercy; and have compassion upon you and multiply you.""9Deuteronomy 13:18. Anyone who is cruel, causes his lineage to be suspect.10The descendants of Abraham are known for their kindness and generosity. One who does not possess this attitude causes his lineage to be doubtful. The Holy One blessed is He, is near to the cry of the poor, as it is said: ""He will hear the cry of the poor.""11Job 34:28. Therefore one must beware of their anguished cry, for a covenant was made with them, as it is said: ""When he cries out to me I will listen, for I am compassionate.""12Exodus 22:26. The Jerusalem Talmud says: The door that doesn't open for the poor will open for the doctor. A person should consider, that he continually requests his sustenance from the Holy One blessed is He; and just as he requests that the Holy One blessed is He, listen to his cry and prayer, so should he listen to the cry of the poor. A person should also consider that [fortune] is a wheel that revolves in the world, and in the end he or his children or his children's children might [have to] accept charity. Let no man think: ""Why should I diminish my wealth by giving it to the poor?"" For he should know that the money is not his, but rather [it was given to him as] a trust, with which to do the will of the One Who entrusted the funds to him. And this [charity giving] will be his real share from all his toils in this world, As it is written:13Isaiah 58:8. ""Your acts of charity shall preceed you [into the World to Come]. Charity voids evil decrees and prolongs life."
Genesis,Vayera,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 18:5,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 32:6,"It is a general rule of healthy practice that before eating, you should engage in some strenuous activity, whether walking or working, so that your body is warmed up, and then you should eat. As the verse says, “By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread,”3Bereishit 3:19. and “She does not eat the bread of laziness.”4Mishlei 31:27. You should loosen your belt before eating. This is hinted at in the verse אקחה פת לחם (“I will take a morsel of bread”5Bereishit 18:5.): the word אקחה in reverse is an acronym for התר חגורה קודם אכילה (“loosen the belt before eating”), and פת לחם is an acronym for פן תבוא לידי חולי מעיים (“lest you cause yourself digestive disorders”). While eating, you should sit in your place or recline on your left side. After eating, don’t move about excessively, because that will cause the food to descend from the stomach before it has been fully digested, which can be harmful; rather one should walk a little and rest. But you should not go on a long walk or engage in strenuous activity after the meal. Nor should you sleep till at least two hours have elapsed after the meal, so that the fumes will not ascend to the head and cause damage. Likewise, bathing, bloodletting and sexual intercourse are not beneficial after a meal."
Genesis,Vayera,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 20:17,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 29:13,"Anyone who hates a fellow-Jew in his heart, transgresses a negative commandment, as it is said: ""Do not hate your brother in your heart.""40Leviticus 19:17. (See Chapter 189: 5) If anyone has sinned against you, you should not hate him inwardly, and keep quiet about it, as it is written concerning the wicked, ""And Avshalom did not speak to Amnon either bad or good because Avshalom hated Amnon,""41II Samuel 13:22. but it is your duty to let him know [what you think of him] and to say to him,42You should not denounce him publicly and thereby embarrass him, rather chide him in private in a calm and gentle tone of voice. (Mishnah Berurah 156:4). ""Why have you done this to me, why have you sinned against me in this matter?"", for it is said: ""You must admonish your neighbor.""43Leviticus 19:17. If the offender regrets it and asks you to forgive him, you should forgive him and not be harsh, for it is said:44Genesis 20:17. ""And Avraham prayed to God.""45Asking God to heal Avimelech. Avimelech had taken away Sarah, but returned her to Avraham, expressing sincere remorse. In Avos de Rabbi Nasan (end of Chapter 16) [it is stated] ""What is meant by 'hatred of people'?"" It conveys this thought: ""A person should not think of saying ""I will love the scholars but hate the students, I will love the students but hate the unlearned."" Rather, you should love them all, but hate the heretics, and those who mislead and entice people, [to abandon the Torah and follow false doctrines], and also [hate] the informers. And thus David said,46Psalms 139:22. ""Behold, those who hate You Hashem, I hate, and with those who rise up against You, I contend. With utmost hatred do I hate them, they have come to be my enemies."" But didn't God say; ""Love your neighbor as [you love] yourself, I am Hashem?"" For what reason? Because I (God) have created him. And if he keeps the laws of your people you must love him, if not, you should not love him."

Genesis,Vayera,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 22:5,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 33:14,"It is forbidden to utter sinister forbodings against a fellow Jew, even just to say [about a missing person], ""If so and so were alive he would have come here,"" for ""A covenant was made with the lips.""8The Gemara [Moed Katan 18a] explains that predictions, whether favorable or otherwise, have a way of becoming reality. When preparing to sacrifice his son, Yitzchak, on the akeidah, Abraham said to his young men; “The boy and I will go to that place … and then return to you,” (Gen. 22:5). His words came true and both did return unscathed. You should not frighten a child with an unclean thing, by saying for instance, ""A cat or a dog will get you."" You should be very careful [to avoid] habitual use of such similar expressions."
Genesis,Chayei Sarah,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 24:14,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 42:1,"If you own animals or birds (poultry), and it is your responsibility to feed them, you are not allowed to eat anything until you feed them, as it is written (Deuteronomy 11:15): ""And I will put grass in your fields for your cattle (animals) and you will eat and be satisfied."" Thus the Torah has given preference to feeding the cattle [animals] before the feeding of man. But as regards drinking, man comes first as it is written (Genesis 24:14): [Rivkah said] ""Drink first and I will also give your camels to drink."" Similarly it is written (Numbers 20:8): ""And you will give drink to the congregation and to their animals."""

Genesis,Toldot,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 27:28,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 41:5,"Before reciting the berachah, place both hands on the bread because the ten fingers are symbolic of the ten mitzvos involved in making bread. [The ten are] 1. It is forbidden to plow with a team comprised of an ox and a donkey. 2. It is forbidden to plant diverse species together. 3. The stalks that fall during harvesting must be left for the poor. 4. A sheaf forgotten in the field must be left for the poor. 5. A corner of the field must be left unharvested for the poor. 6. It is forbidden to muzzle a working animal. 7. A portion of grain must be separated and given to the kohein (priestly family). 8. A tenth of the remaining harvest must be given to the Levite. 9. A tenth of the remaining harvest is then separated to be taken up to Jerusalem and eaten by the owner. 10. A piece of the dough is separated and given to the kohein. For this same reason there are ten words in the berachah of Hamotzi, and ten words in the verse (Psalms 145:15): ""The eyes of all look expectantly to You"" etc., and ten words in the verse (Deuteronomy 8:8): ""A land of wheat and barley"" etc., and ten words in the verse (Genesis 27:28): ""And may Hashem give you"" etc. When you pronounce the Name of Hashem, lift up the bread. On Shabbos lift up both loaves, and recite the berachah with concentration, making sure to enunciate clearly the letter hei in the word Hamotzi. Also allow a short pause between saying the word lechem and the word min, so as not to slur over the letter mem. After reciting the berachah, you must immediately eat the bread, because it is forbidden to interrupt between saying the berachah and eating [the bread], even to answer Amein. You should try to eat a kazayis of bread without interruption."
Genesis,Vayetzei,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 28:11,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 124:2,"You should express grief in the manner of your sleeping. For example, if you are accustomed to sleep on two pillows, you should sleep only on one. Some people have the custom to sleep on the floor during the night of Tishah beAv, and to put a stone underneath their head as a reminder of what was said, ""And he took some of the stones of the place etc.,"" (Genesis 28:11). Our Sages comment that Jacob foresaw the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash and said, ""How frightful"" etc. (verse 17). It all depends on the person's attitude.2A pregnant woman or any weak (or sick) person is not obligated to do any of these things. (Ibid. 555:7)"
Genesis,Vayeshev,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 38:25,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 29:17,"It is forbidden to humiliate anyone either by word or by deed, especially in public. And our Rabbis of blessed memory said,52Bava Metzia 58b. ""A person who humiliates someone in public will have no share in the World to Come."" Our Rabbis of blessed memory said furthermore,53Ibid, 59a. ""It is better for a man to throw himself into a fiery furnace than to put his fellow man to shame,"" for it is said:54Genesis 38:25. This refers to the incident of Tamar and Yehudah. ""When she was being taken out [to be executed] she sent word to her father-in-law, saying: ""By the man who is the owner of these articles I am pregnant."" She did not say to him openly [that it was of him that she conceived] she merely hinted, [thinking] if he admits it, fine, if not, I will not expose him publicly."" Therefore, you should be very careful not to humiliate anyone in public, whether he is a minor or an adult, nor to call anyone by a name of which he is ashamed, and do not relate in his presence anything of which he is ashamed. And if anyone sinned against you and it is necessary for you to admonish him [for it], do not humiliate him, for it is said:55Leviticus 19:17. ""Do not sin through him.""56Do not embarass him publicly. (Rashi) This law applies only to a case where he [sinned] against his fellow man, but if he [sinned] against God, and does not retract [and repent] when you admonish him privately, you may disgrace him publicly, and publicize his transgression, and you may revile him to his face, you may insult him and curse him until he returns to the good [path], as all the prophets in Israel have done. Regarding such a person [the law prohibiting] the making of disparaging remarks does not apply for it is said:57Leviticus 25:17. ""Do not speak slightingly to one another,""58Alternately translated “Do not cheat one another.” Rashi explains that this verse contains the prohibition against verbal abuse, i.e. not to taunt anyone, nor give bad or unsuitable advice. and the Rabbis of blessed memory explain, that the word amiso [to your fellow man], applies to those who are of one mind with you in their observance of the Torah and the mitzvos. The Torah forbids you to abuse them verbally, but you are not [prohibited from verbally abusing] those persons who violate [the Torah] and do not repent [even] after they have been admonished privately, and with gentle words."

It is obtained by making an incision into the tree trunk, stripping the bark, after which the oil trickles out. (Mishnah Berurah 216: 22) which grows in the Land of Israel, enjoys a prominence as a product of the Land of Israel, and a special berachah has been instituted for it, which reads: Borei shemen areiv [Who has created pleasant-scented oil]."
Genesis,Vayechi,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh,Genesis 48:16,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 138:9,"In the daytime, after the Hakafos, three Sifrei Torah are left out, and many people are called up to one Seifer Torah, to read the portion Vezos haberachah up to Me'onah (Deut. 33:27) repeating it many times. At the end, all the young boys are called up. It is proper that a boy who is bar mitzvah should say the berachah and that the others should listen.4They will be exempt with his berachah. The verse Hamalach hagoel is read for them5According to Levush this verse is recited over them as an oral blessing, but it is not read. (Ibid 669:14) [The angel who delivered me] etc. (Genesis 48:16). After that, the Chasan Torah is called up and he reads from Me'onah to the end [of the Torah]. In the second Seifer Torah, the Chasan Bereishis reads. Then half-kaddish is said. In the third Seifer Torah, Maftir is read. (see chapter 79:1 above) It is the custom in many communities to be mindful to call up an eminent person for Chasan Torah. Even a person who was called up already for the reading of Vezos haberachah, may still be called up as Chasan Torah or as Chasan Bereishis. Where there are only two Sifrei Torah, Vezos haberachah should be read in one, and Bereishis in the other one, and the first seifer is taken again for Maftir."
